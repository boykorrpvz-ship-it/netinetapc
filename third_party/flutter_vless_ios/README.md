[![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_vless.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vless)

Federated Flutter plugin for VLESS, VMESS, Trojan, Shadowsocks, and SOCKS on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.

This package exposes a small Dart API for parsing share links and subscriptions, generating Xray configs, and starting either proxy-only or VPN/tunnel mode through platform backends.

The package is open source and free to use, with Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows support included out of the box. The longer guides live under `doc/`.
For long-form docs, see the `documentation` link in `pubspec.yaml`.

## At A Glance

| Platform | Mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | VPN, proxy-only | `blockedApps` is supported. Emulator support is split into a separate package. |
| iOS | VPN, proxy-only | Real device required for packet-tunnel testing. App Group and Network Extension are required. |
| macOS | VPN, proxy-only | Packet Tunnel setup is required. See the macOS architecture notes for route and DNS details. |
| Windows | VPN, proxy-only | Xray must be available locally. Admin rights may be required for tunnel mode. |

## Key Capabilities

- Android 16KB page size support for modern builds.
- Swift Package Manager support for iOS and macOS integration.
- Separate Android emulator package for x86_64 emulator targets.
- Share-link, subscription, raw JSON, Clash YAML, and sing-box import paths.
- Proxy-only mode and VPN/tunnel mode.
- Runtime delay checks and status tracking.
- Typed Xray config helpers for more explicit advanced configuration.

## Try The Example First

The example app is the quickest way to verify platform setup before copying the
plugin into your own project.

```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d windows
```

iOS needs a signed real device for VPN mode, macOS needs the Packet Tunnel
setup, and Windows needs `example/windows/xray/xray.exe`.

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_vless: ^1.1.1
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

If you need the Android emulator binaries, add the emulator package as well:

```bash
flutter pub add flutter_vless_android_emulator
```

## Quick Start

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vless/flutter_vless.dart';

final flutterVless = FlutterVless(
  onStatusChanged: (status) {
    debugPrint(
      'status=${status.state} connection=${status.connectionState.name} '
      'delay=${status.duration}s',
    );
  },
);

Future<void> connect(String shareLink) async {
  final parsed = FlutterVless.parse(shareLink);
  final config = parsed.getFullConfiguration();

  await flutterVless.initializeVless(
    providerBundleIdentifier: 'com.example.myapp',
    groupIdentifier: 'group.com.example.myapp',
  );

  if (await flutterVless.requestPermission()) {
    await flutterVless.startVless(
      remark: parsed.remark,
      config: config,
    );
  }
}
```

For proxy-only mode, set `proxyOnly: true` in `startVless()` and skip the VPN permission step on the paths that do not require a tunnel.

`startVless()` and `getServerDelay()` validate that the provided config is a
well-formed Xray JSON object before the native layer sees it.

## Supported Inputs

`FlutterVless.parse()` and `FlutterVless.parseMany()` support:

- `vmess://`
- `vless://`
- `trojan://`
- `ss://`
- `socks://`
- raw Xray JSON
- base64 subscription payloads
- Clash YAML
- sing-box JSON

Use `parse()` for a single share link or a raw config, and `parseMany()` when you want to keep every supported profile from a subscription payload.

## Advanced Usage

The parsed URL objects expose low-level Xray maps for advanced configuration work, including inbound, routing, log, and stream settings. That is intentionally powerful, but it is also intentionally low-level.

If you want a typed config builder instead of mutating maps, see
`lib/url/xray_config_model.dart` and `lib/url/xray_config_validator.dart`.
Those helpers are useful when you want to construct or validate a config before
turning it into JSON.

If you need to edit the runtime config, start with [Configuration Guide](doc/configuration.md) and [Architecture Notes](doc/architecture.md).

## Example App
